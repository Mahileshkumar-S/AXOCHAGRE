# AxoCharge âš¡
A Regenerative Energy System for Commercial Electric Vehicles using Differential Axle Bevel Gear Mechanism.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project introduces an energy-harvesting system that converts differential axle rotation into electric energy using a bevel gear and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG).  
- Achieved 90.25% system efficiency  
- Adds ~3.8 km of range per hour  
- Designed for EV buses, trucks, and logistics vehicles
